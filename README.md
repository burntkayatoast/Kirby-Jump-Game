## Microprocessor's game project - Year 2
A Microprocessor project that is based on the online google dino game. However, instead of the original dinosaur character, it's been replaced by Kirby. Obstacles have also been changed from cacti and birds to related characters from the game, such as gordo, waddle and the star.

Created on the PlatformIO extension on VSCode in C for the nucleo_l031k6 board.
